# ZK-ThreatIntel

A Zero-Knowledge based Threat Intelligence web application built with TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.  
This project aims to provide a privacy-preserving way to query threat intelligence data, leveraging zero-knowledge proofs and modern frontend tooling.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (v16 or higher)  
- npm or yarn  
- Git (optional, if cloning the repository)

### Installation

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sourabh200401/ZK-ThreatIntel.git  
cd ZK-ThreatIntel  

# install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install
Running in Development
bash
Copy code
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
This will start a local development server (usually at http://localhost:3000) which auto-reloads on file changes.

Building for Production
bash
Copy code
npm run build
# or
yarn build
After building, the production-ready files will be generated to the dist/ directory, ready for deployment.

Zero-Knowledge Proofs
Explain here how you use zero-knowledge proofs:

What ZK system or library you're using (e.g. snarkjs, zk-SNARKs, Bulletproofs, etc.)

How proofs are generated and verified

What threat intelligence queries are performed privately

Any privacy/security assumptions or limitations

Usage
Example workflow
User enters an indicator of compromise (IOC) — e.g. a hash, IP address, domain.

A zero-knowledge proof is generated locally to prove the IOC is valid without revealing it.

The proof is sent to a verification service or backend, which checks the IOC against a threat intelligence database.

The backend responds with a verdict (e.g. “malicious”, “benign”, “unknown”) without seeing the raw IOC.

The frontend displays the verdict and optionally additional threat details.

You can illustrate a sample request/response JSON, or show screenshots of the UI here.
